## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The use of `text-shadow` property in CSS to create a glowing effect on text.
- Use of margin for spacing things.
- Using flexbox and flex-wrap to make things responsive without needing media queries.
- Using flex-basis to set the initial size of flex items.

### Continued development

I want to keep improving at:

- CSS layouts (especially grid for more complex designs).
- Writing cleaner, scalable CSS for bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) - This helped me in understanding how to use different CSS properties.
